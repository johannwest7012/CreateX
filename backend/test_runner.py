# To test statement coverage and path coverage of a Django application using the coverage package, you can follow these steps:

# Install the coverage package using pip:
# Copy code
# pip install coverage
# Navigate to your Django project directory in your terminal.

# Run the tests with coverage and enable the coverage options to collect statement coverage and path coverage data:

# bash
# Copy code
# coverage run --source='.' --branch manage.py test
# The --source option specifies the source code to be measured for coverage. In this case, we set it to the root directory of our project ('.') to measure coverage for all our source files.

# The --branch option enables branch coverage measurement, which allows us to collect path coverage data.

# Generate a coverage report:
# Copy code
# coverage report -m
# This will generate a report showing the coverage for each module and function in your code, including statement coverage and path coverage data.

# The -m option shows the line numbers and missing lines for each file in the report.

# To get more detailed information about path coverage, you can generate a HTML report with annotated source code:
# css
# Copy code
# coverage html --omit='*/tests/*'
# This will generate a report in the htmlcov directory with annotated source code highlighting the executed and missed paths.

# The --omit option tells coverage to exclude test files from the report.

# By using these steps, you can measure statement coverage and path coverage for your Django application and generate detailed reports to help identify gaps in your test coverage.
